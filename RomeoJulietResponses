Romeo: 001+
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?+
It is the east, and you are the sun.+
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon.
 
Juliet: yo
 
Romeo: 002+
She speaks:+
O, speak again, bright angel!
 
Juliet: hello
 
Romeo: 003+
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
 
Juliet: whats up
 
Romeo: 100+
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
