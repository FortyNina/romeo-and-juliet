Ay me!
-

01+
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
-

02+
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,+
So stumblest on my counsel?

-

03+
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

-

04+
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.


-

05+
Ay

06+
line

-

07+
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
-

08+
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

-

09+
be but sworn my love,+
And I'll not longer be a Capulet

-
10+
My only love sprung from my only hate!

-
11+
Then I am well and nothing can be ill.

-
12+
For stony limits cannot hold love out
-

13+
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
-
14+
Young men's love then lies+
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
-

15+
A thousand times goodnight.

-
16+

What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
