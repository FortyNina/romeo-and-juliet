001+
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?+
It is the east, and you are the sun.+
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon.
-
002+
She speaks:+
O, speak again, bright angel!
-
003+
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
-





100+
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
-
101+
I know not how to tell thee who I am:+
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
-
102+
it is an enemy to thee+
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
-
103+
I am a dog of the house of Montague+
Shall I deny my father and refuse my name?
-
104+
What shouldst i change mine own family name to? 
-
105+
new name+
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;+
Henceforth I never will be Montague.+
But if thy kinsmen do see me, they will murder me
-
106+
my life is my foe's debt.+
Art thou not a Capulet?
-
107+
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.+
Thou art thyself, though not a Capulet.+
What's Capulet? It is nor hand, nor foot,+
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part+
Belonging to a woman. O, be some other name!
-
108+
O blessed, blessed night!+
What is thy family name?
-
109+
new name+
Shall I take thee at thy word?+
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words+
Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.
-




150+
new name+
Shall I take thy own name?+
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;+
Henceforth I never will be a Montague.+
But if they kinsmen do see me, they will murder me
-
151+
new name+
Romeo, and a Montague,+
The only son of your great enemy.
-

175+
My only love sprung from my only hate!+
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!+
Prodigous birth of love it is to me+
That I must love a loathed enemy.+
Art thou not Juliet, and Capulet?

-




200+
Dost thou love me? I hope thou wilt day "Ay,"+
And I will take thy word.
-


300+
A "robot"?+
Am I fated to respond this way?+
O, I am fortune's fool!+
Art thou really real?
-
301+
Is it e'en so?—Then I deny you, stars!—+
I am afeard,+
Being in night, all this is but a dream,+
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
-
302+
So thrive my soul—+
O, that I were a glove upon thy hand,+
That I might touch that cheek!
-

400+
How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,+
For nothing can be ill if thou art well.
-
401+
then i too am blank+
But bright angel, thou art+
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,+
As is a winged messenger of heaven+
...+
Shall I go on?
-

402+
But bright angel, thou art+
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,+
As is a winged messenger of heaven+
...+
Shall I go on?
-


403+
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,+
Having some business, do entreat thy eyes+
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.+
What if thy eyes were there, they in thy head?+
The brightness of thy cheek would shame those stars+
Doth thee feel better?
-

404+
O, with love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,+
But I must ask thee one more question.
-

1000+
Rosaline? no;+
I have forgotten that name, and that name's woe.
-
1001+
Good night, good night! parting is such+
sweet sorrow.+
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
-
1002+
Thank thee+
O, that I were a glove upon thy hand,+
That I might touch that cheek!
-
1003+
No, fair saint, if thee dislike
-
1004+
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
-
1005+
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
-
1007+
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
-
1008+
end of demo
-


2000+
O, thou doth teach the torches to burn bright!+
For I ne'er saw tru beauty till this night.
