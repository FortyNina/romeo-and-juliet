But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?+
It is the east, and you are the sun.+
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon.

She speaks:+
O, speak again, bright angel!
-
003+
It is my lady, O, it is my love!

Ay me! sad hours seem long.
-
101+
I know not how to tell thee who I am:+
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
-
102+

Had I it written, I would tear the word.
-
103+
I am a dog of the house of Montague+
Doth thee wish I change mine own name?
-
104+
What shouldst i change mine own family name to? 
-
105+
new name+
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;+
Henceforth I never will be Montague.

Rosaline? no;+
I have forgotten that name, and that name's woe.
-

Good night, good night! parting is such+
sweet sorrow.+
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
-
1002+
Thank thee+
O, that I were a glove upon thy hand,+
That I might touch that cheek!
-
1003+
No, fair saint, if thee dislike
-
1004+
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
-
1005+
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
-
1006+
A "robot"?+
Am I fated to respond this way?+
O, I am fortune's fool!
